## Summary: 

The analysis did not show a positivity bias for the Amazon Vine rating program. Less than one percent of five star reviews came from Vine members. The vast majority of reviews that were five stars were not part of the Amazon Vine program. Therefore there is not evidence for a positivity bias for reviews in the Amazon Vine program. An additional analysis that could be done to test bias would be to measure the different percentages in one star ratings.
